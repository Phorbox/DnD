Such gear is usually issued to both military units and pistol-armed forces such as the Corvis Watch.																								
AOE	AOE	This weapon's ammunition explodes when it hits a target and may hit nearby creatures standing as well. Each other creature within a number of feet equal to the AOE range (noted in parentheses) must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 13 or 10 + the attacker's proficiency bonus, whichever is higher. On a failed save, the creature takes half of the damage taken by the target.																								
Armor Resistance Treatment	Armor Resistance Treatment	The people of the Iron Kingdoms have devised multiple methods of resisting certain types of damage, whether the electrical shielding incorporated into the Storm Division's armor, the alchemical resistance worked into the protective coverings worn by Crucible Guard infantry and countless other independent alchemists, or simply the heavy insulation lining a Winter																								
Armored Apron	Armored Apron	Reinforced with metal plates on its inner surface, this tough leatherworker's apron is designed to protect the wearer's abdomen and upper legs. It is often worn by mechaniks to safeguard against workplace hazards. Infantry Armor. Consisting of an armored chest plate, shoulder pads, and armored leggings over layers of leather and sometimes chain, infantry armor exists in numerous variations throughout the Iron Kingdom's many armies and mercenary companies. Cygnar's trenchers and long gunners, Khador's Winter Guard, and Rhul's gun corps all wear variations of this armor.																								
Armored Greatcoat	Armored Greatcoat	The armored greatcoat is popular among combatants and adventurers across western Immoren. Made up of layers of leather, chain, and plate, it not only provides protection against weaponry, but also serves as a barrier against inclement weather. A character wearing an armored greatcoat gains +1 AC. An armored greatcoat can be worn over light armor.																								
Assault Shield	Assault Shield	A combat shield has spikes or blades mounted on its front face, allowing it to be used as a weapon in close fighting. If you successfully shove a target while equipped with a combat shield, the target takes 1d4 piercing damage.																								
Bayonet	Bayonet	Bayonets are small, dagger-like blades that can be affixed to the barrel of a firearm. They are most often affixed to military rifles used by soldiers in close-quarter trench warfare. Some specialized bayonets have been crafted for use with both multibarreled firearms and crossbows. A bayonet attached to a ranged weapon allows you to make melee attacks without relinquishing your weapon. When not attached to a pistol or rifle, a bayonet is considered an improvised weapon. When mounted on the end of a rifle, a bayonet gains versatile (1d8)																								
Blasting Pike	Blasting Pike	The Iron Fang blasting pike is among the most devastating polearms ever developed in western Immoren. It is tipped with a powerful explosive charge that delivers a directional blast capable of obliterating common foes and ripping gaping holes in warjacks. The explosion can also knock any surviving foes to the ground. If you hit a target with a blasting pike, you can choose to detonate the pike's explosive head before you roll for damage. If you do, the target takes an additional 1d10 bludgeoning damage and must make a Strength saving throw with a DC of 10 or half the total damage dealt, whichever is higher. On a failed save, the target is knocked prone. You cannot use this feature again until you rearm the blasting pike with a new explosive head and cannot use the blasting pike as a normal weapon again until you rearm it with either a new explosive head or a standard spearhead. A blasting pike armed with a standard spearhead cannot be detonated in this manner but does not need to be rearmed between attacks.																								
Bola	Bola	A bola is a simple throwing weapon made of lengths of rope and chain affixed together and ending in heavy weights. The weapon causes little damage, as its true purpose is to entangle and trip its target. A Large or smaller creature hit by a bola must succeed on a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or be knocked prone.																								
Cannon-Shield	Cannon-Shield	This device consists of a heavy, short-range rifle mounted in the center of a shield. It can be used as both a shield and a ranged weapon. A cannon-shield grants +2 AC while it is equipped.																								
Clockwork Injector	Clockwork Injector	This complex device consists of a fragile tube terminating in a maw of sharp needles with four vials mounted on a gear-driven carousel. Each vial can be loaded with one dose of an injectable alchemical substance or poison. The wielder simply selects one of the vials, and the device swiftly rotates the correct vial into position. Although the clockwork injector is far from a serviceable weapon, it can quickly deliver a number of alchemical solutions. A creature hit with a clockwork injector takes 1 piercing damage and is exposed to the selected alchemical solution or poison. Injecting an unwilling creature requires an attack roll, and the clockwork injector is treated as an improvised weapon. It takes 1 minute to replace or refill the contents of a clockwork injector.																								
Coal Shovel	Coal Shovel	When another creature targets you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to try and parry the attack with the head of this weapon. If you do, you gain +1 AC against that attack. You cannot use this reaction while also wielding a shield.																								
Dual Hand Cannon	Dual Hand Cannon	Extremely heavy and well-made pistols, hand cannons are expensive firearms most commonly found in the possession of ranking military officers. These enormous handguns pack a significant punch and are accurate to a range far beyond that of most other pistols. A dual hand cannon has two barrels. Each can be fired independently, or both can be discharged together to produce a massive single blast. When you make an attack with a dual hand cannon, you can choose to fire one or both barrels. If you fire both barrels, you make the attack with disadvantage, but if the attack hits, you score a critical hit.																								
Dual Magelock Pistol	Dual Magelock Pistol	A dual magelock pistol has two barrels. Each can be fired independently, or both can be discharged together in a single attack. When you make an attack with a dual magelock pistol, you can choose to fire one or both barrels. If you fire both barrels, you make the attack with disadvantage, but you can apply two of your Rune Shot options to that attack.																								
Firearm	Firearm	You can use a weapon that has the firearm property to make a ranged attack, but only if ammunition is loaded into the weapon's magazine. Each time you attack with a firearm, you expend one round from the magazine. Rounds fired from a firearm are destroyed. A firearm produces a loud report when fired. Unless affected by mechanikal or magical silence, creatures with the ability to hear can hear the sound of a firearm discharging from a great distance, sometimes up to a mile or more in open conditions.																								
Flame Spear	Flame Spear	This spear has a reservoir of Menoth's Fury that ignites when the weapon strikes a target. A flame spear does an additional 1d6 fire damage, and its reservoir holds enough fuel for 12 attacks before it needs to be refueled. If you have 5 gp worth of Menoth's Fury, you can use an action or a bonus action to refuel this weapon.																								
Gaff Spear	Gaff Spear	A large hook is mounted at the base of the spearhead of this sturdy weapon, which can be used as a spear but also allows you to make a special trip attack with the hook. If you use a gaff spear to shove a creature, you have advantage on the Strength (Athletics) check.																								
Gas Mask	Gas Mask	Once unique to the Golden Crucible's workshops, gas masks have become a rare but not unobtainable piece of gear throughout the Iron Kingdoms. Affixed tightly to the head with adjustable buckles and straps, this face mask creates an impermeable seal around the wearer's mouth and nose. The mask's “breather” is a large oblong leather sack affixed to the mask with a metal screw cap. Alchemically treated fibers in the filter allow clean air in but prevent particles and alchemical substances from permeating the filter's membranes, thereby allowing the wearer to breathe in dangerous or outright caustic environments without fear of damaging the lungs or windpipe. A character can don or doff a gas mask as a bonus action. While wearing a gas mask, a character suffers a -5 penalty to passive Perception but is immune to inhaled toxins, such as those produced by the stinking cloud spell. Replacement filters for a gas mask cost 5 gp each and provide enough protection for 1 hour of exposure to caustic gases and other undesirable particles the wearer might breathe.																								
Goggles	Goggles	Created for mechaniks, alchemists, and others who work in hazardous professions, goggles have entered widespread use across western Immoren. Made of thick glass with adjustable leather straps, they protect the wearer's eyes from flying metal fragments and other dangers. A character wearing goggles has advantage on saving throws to avoid being blinded.																								
Grenade	Grenade	You must throw this weapon to make a ranged attack with it. Add your Dexterity modifier to the attack roll, but do not add it to the damage roll.																								
Grenade Bandolier	Grenade Bandolier	A grenade bandolier is a leather belt with loops that can store up to 6 grenades for easy access.																								
Guard soldier's uniform	Guard soldier's uniform	When armor you wear receives this treatment, choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, or lightning. You have resistance to the chosen damage type while wearing the armor.																								
Gun Brace	Gun Brace	A gun brace is effectively a heavy leather bandolier for pistols. It has enough sleeves to hold three or four pistols. Some gunfighters and pirates are even known to wear two full braces of loaded pistols. Rather than reloading, a character with a gun brace simply pulls another pistol when it comes time to make an attack. A character wearing a gun brace can draw two pistols as part of a single attack action. Some pirates simply tie a length of rope between two pistols and hang them around the neck as a cheap alternative to the gun brace. If you want to begin the game with a rope gun brace of this kind, you can do so for free, but it is not reliable. If you are wearing a rope gun brace and roll a 1 on the d20 for a Dexterity check or Dexterity saving throw, the brace falls from your neck.																								
Harpoon Gun	Harpoon Gun	This specially designed firearm is designed to propel a harpoon over long distances. It typically has short, stout barrels and is fitted with iron rings that can be used both to tie off the harpoon line and to anchor the harpoon gun into secured mounting, such as that found on a ship. The true range of a harpoon gun is limited by the rope or cable attached to it. If a harpoon fired from a harpoon gun damages a creature, the harpoon embeds in it. As an action, you can attempt to pull a Large or smaller creature with an embedded harpoon closer by making a contested Strength (Athletics) check against the creature's Strength (Athletics) check. If you succeed, you pull the creature 5 feet closer. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the line (AC 7) destroys it without causing additional damage to the harpooned creature.																								
Heavy warcaster armor	Heavy warcaster armor	This warcaster armor is based on extremely heavy full plate armor and fitted with a huge boiler and arcane turbine. Although the armor is effectively weightless, its sheer bulk somewhat restricts its wearer's movement. Heavy warcaster armor incorporates an arcane turbine with a power draw of 5 charges per hour for the bond plate and the power field's mechanikal devices. Additional devices can be connected to the turbine, as described in the arcane turbine rules. If this armor does not have power, its wearer has -2 AC. Additionally, while it does not have power, this armor reduces its wearer's speed by 10 feet, and the wearer has disadvantage on Stealth checks unless the wearer has Strength 15 or higher.																								
Hidden	Hidden	The true nature of this weapon is concealed until the wielder reveals it or a creature discovers it. A creature within 10 feet of the weapon can discern its true nature if the creature has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of at least 20 or if the creature is actively looking for concealed weapons and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. A creature that handles a weapon disguised to look like something else discovers the weapon's true nature if the creature has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of at least 10 or automatically if the creature is actively looking for concealed weapons.																								
Knuckledusters	Knuckledusters	Knuckledusters are metal braces made to fit over the hand in order to increase the damage of punches and strikes with the hand. You can use this weapon to make an unarmed strike. On a hit, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. (If your unarmed strikes already roll a damage die, you can reroll the damage die when you roll a 1 but must use the new roll.)																								
Light warcaster armor	Light warcaster armor	This warcaster armor is made of lightweight plate and includes a breastplate designed to support the armor's turbine and boiler. Because much of the warcaster's body is left unarmored, this armor relies primarily on the power field for protection. Light warcaster armor incorporates an arcane turbine with a power draw of 5 charges per hour for the bond plate and the power field's mechanikal devices. Additional devices can be connected to the turbine, as described in the arcane turbine rules. If this armor does not have power, its wearer has -2 AC.																								
Magazine	Magazine	A weapon with the magazine property has an amount of ammunition stored inside it (noted in parentheses). Once you use the weapon to make a number of attacks equal to its magazine rating, you must use an action or a bonus action (your choice) in order to reload it.																								
Magelock	Magelock	A magelock weapon is specially hardened against the effects of a gun mage's rune shots. While in the hands of a gun mage, a magelock weapon is a magic weapon.																								
Medium warcaster armor	Medium warcaster armor	This warcaster armor is based on the infantry armor used throughout the Iron Kingdoms. Although it invariably includes a fitted breastplate that houses the armor's arcane turbine, other elements vary from nearly full suits of plate armor to armored shoulder and leg elements in combination with an armored greatcoat. Medium warcaster armor incorporates an arcane turbine with a power draw of 5 charges per hour for the bond plate and the power field's mechanikal devices. Additional devices can be connected to the turbine, as described in the arcane turbine rules. If this armor does not have power, its wearer has -2 AC. Additionally, while it does not have power, this armor reduces its wearer's speed by 10 feet, and the wearer has disadvantage on Stealth checks unless the wearer has Strength 13 or higher.																								
Misfire	Misfire	If you roll equal to or lower than a weapon's misfire rating (noted in parentheses), the weapon jams as its ammunition fails. The attack automatically misses, and the weapon cannot be used again unless you use an action or a bonus action to clear the chamber and fix whatever caused the weapon to misfire.																								
Nyss Claymore	Nyss Claymore	These weapons have become very rare since the disaster that befell the Nyss in 606 AR. Most such blades found outside of northern Khador are either family heirlooms fiercely guarded by the refugees who wield them or the prized possessions of wealthy collectors. If a player wants to purchase a Nyss claymore, the GM should first determine whether such a weapon is available and then, if so, determine an appropriate price.																								
Rearm	Rearm	You can use a weapon that has the rearm property to make a melee attack, but only if you have the expendable component the weapon uses. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend this component. You must take a bonus action to draw the component from a bandolier or another container and attach it to the weapon. If you use a weapon that has the rearm property to make a melee attack without replacing the expendable component, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon.																								
Springblade	Springblade	A favorite of assassins and street fighters alike, this weapon is a dagger with a retractable blade in its hilt. When a wielder touches a button on the weapon's handle, a powerful internal spring forces the blade outward, at which point the blade is locked in place and ready to be used in combat. You can draw or sheathe a springblade for free, even if you've already drawn or sheathed a weapon during your turn.																								
Stave of Authority	Stave of Authority	A stave of authority is a weapon of steel or banded hardwood set with a heavy head and a tip capable of delivering crushing blows. The clergy of Menoth favor these battle staves as their primary armaments and symbols of office. Being granted to priests to denote their station with the clergy, these items are not normally available for purchase. If a player wants to purchase a stave of authority, the GM should first determine whether such a weapon is available and then, if so, determine an appropriate price. A stave of authority can be used as a holy symbol.																								
STEAM ARMOR	STEAM ARMOR	Steam armor has several unique features, as described below. •While you are operating steam armor that has power, you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. • Steam armor has a damage threshold of 5 and a critical damage threshold of 10. • You have a maximum Dexterity modifier of 0 while wearing steam armor. • While wearing steam armor, your base speed becomes 20 unless it is already lower. • If you are wearing steam armor and hit a target with an unarmed strike, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. Power Plant. The fuel load of medium steam armor is 10 pounds of coal and 5 gallons of water, which allows for roughly 5 hours of general labor or 1 hour of combat. Heavy armor requires 20 pounds of coal and 8 gallons of water. Operating at full steam implies that the armor is running its boiler under combat conditions, in which case 1 minute at full steam is equal to 5 minutes at normal power. If you are wearing steam armor that doesn't have power, you are subjected to the full weight of the armor. Your speed drops by an additional 10 feet, and you have disadvantage on saving throws and ability checks that use Strength or Dexterity until the armor has power again. A steam armor's power plant has the same vulnerability to water as a steamjack's boiler																								
Storm	Storm	As a bonus action, you can activate or deactivate this weapon. While activated, this weapon deals 1d4 lightning damage in addition to its normal damage. Each time you make an attack with this weapon while it is activated, you suffer 1d4 lightning damage after resolving the attack. For more on this weapon, see “Mechanika” on p. 213.

Weatherometer	Weatherometer	Utilizing advances made by the Royal College of Cygnar to chart general information about weather conditions and even make predictions about the weather for short periods of time, this construction of wood and metal includes a number of small, clever devices that measure various effects, including the speed and direction of the wind, precipitation, air pressure, and temperature. Portable weatherometers are cherished by adventurers, sailors, and merchants alike. If rumors are to be believed, the Royal College is currently researching a mechanikal version of this device that can acquire more detailed information over a larger area. Setting up or breaking down a weatherometer takes 10 minutes. If you use a weatherometer, you make Wisdom (Nature) and Wisdom (Survival) skill checks with advantage to measure and predict weather conditions for the next 24 hours.																								
Ammunition	Ammunition	You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.

Thrown	Thrown	If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon.
